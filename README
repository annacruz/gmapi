=========================================================
Google Maps API v3 and Static Maps API helper app.
=========================================================

#TODO include Examples


This app allows you to define Google Map and Marker objects in Python.

These objects are designed to be serialized to JSON and parsed by the included
jQuery plugin which converts them to actual Google Map and Marker instances.

They can also be serialized to strings which produces a Static Maps url.

This way you can easily use unobtrusive javascript techniques along with maps.

Version 3 of the Google Geocoding Web service is also implemented to further
enable an unobtrusive javascript approach.

New: Events and Info Windows
You can now add info windows maps and markers and add event listeners.
Adding to the example below, in your views.py (right after "gmap =
maps.Map...") add:

    marker = maps.Marker(opts = {
        'map': gmap,
        'position': maps.LatLng(38, -97),
    })
    maps.event.addListener(marker, 'mouseover', 'myobj.markerOver')
    maps.event.addListener(marker, 'mouseout', 'myobj.markerOut')
    info = maps.InfoWindow({
        'content': 'Hello!',
        'disableAutoPan': True
    })
    info.open(gmap, marker)

Then, on your page:

<script type="text/javascript">
    window.myobj = {
        markerOver: function() { this.openInfoWindow(); },
        markerOut: function() { this.closeInfoWindow(); }
    };
</script>

That's it!
